# Snake-Game-Turtle

The Game is programmed in Python-3. I have used the Turtle Module.

# Getting Started - Setup Turtle:

# macOS/Linux
If you are a macOS User or Linux user, run the following command to create a new virtual environment:
"python3 -m venv turtle_env"
Once the environment is created, let's activate it:
"source turtle_env/bin/activate"

# Windows
If you are a Windows user then, you need to install virtualenv module to set up a virtual environment. It is pretty simple using pip in Python. To install virtualenv module, run:
"pip install virtualenv"
Then create a new environment:
"virtualenv turtle_env"
Then activate the virtual environment:
"cd turtle/env/Scripts" then "ACTIVATE"

Once the virtual environment setup is done. We need to install the turtle module to start using it for game development.Run the following command to install the turtle module:
"pip install turtle"
